This project is a weather app developed using Python and the Tkinter library for the graphical user interface. The app uses the OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve weather data for a specific location, and displays the current temperature, weather condition, wind speed, and feels-like temperature in Celsius. The GUI is designed with a canvas, which displays a background image, logo, and various weather-related icons depending on the weather condition. Users can also subscribe to the service by entering their email, and receive a subscription confirmation email via the smtplib library. The project demonstrates proficiency in Python programming, API integration, GUI design, and email automation.
